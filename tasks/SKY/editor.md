# Sky Editor Tasks

- **Detailed metrics per protocol**: https://github.com/aragon/ownership-token-framework/tree/development/src/data/metrics.json

Metrics.json provides how we have structured the metrics data by protocol. The information hierachy here is important.

1. We define summaries that make human readable scanning easy. These appear for each token in the criteria and metric summaries.

2. Technical details and references appear in evidence.

3. It's almost always useful to define a group of evidences with full technical details and then provide the evidence links

4. Inside the metric and criteria summaries, bolding and newlines can massively enhance readability. You can't do this inside evidence groups.
