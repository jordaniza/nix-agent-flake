# CRV Task — Editor Instructions

This is a data dashboard, not a written report. Focus on:

- Page title and any explanatory text is clear and free of typos
- Chart titles and axis labels are reader-friendly (e.g. "CRV vs cvxCRV Price (USD)" not "price_usd")
- Consistent number formatting (2 decimal places for prices, 1 for percentages)
- Color choices are accessible and distinguishable
- The page has a sensible layout — charts should not overlap or require horizontal scrolling
- Any source attribution or footnotes are accurate
