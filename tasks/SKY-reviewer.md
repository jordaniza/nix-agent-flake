# Review notes: Apply Aragon Ownership Token Framework to SKY (ex-MakerDAO)

The main task of the reviewer here is twofold:

1. Ensure that the claims made are verifiable
2. Ensure that the claims made are not falsifiable

## Verifiable

Define your own matrix of claims made in the research report.

Independently verify:

1. The claim has an associated piece of data that is linked to.
2. The linked data provides supporting evidence for the claim.
3. The linked data is specific - it links to a specific github line or section of documentation, or can be verified with a specific onchain or API call.
4. Supporting data corroborates the claim, such as EVM call data for a view function.

## Falsifiable

Try and invalidate each claim - is it exhaustive proof or is it an extrapolation?

What would cause it to be invalidated - can we find any evidence?
